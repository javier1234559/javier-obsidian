# Quora - What's the best way to take notes for English learning


Language learners have it rough in note taking. They have to overcome many difficulties:

•Must maintain attention and focus in L2

•Rapidly process and evaluate new information

•Write accurately under time-stress

•Be aware of transitions

•Understand body language

•Recognize re-phrasing and emphasis

One method of note-taking that I think is good for ELLs is the Cornell method

The steps or mixed up in the image. Start with jotting some notes. Put unknown vocab or main ideas in the third column. And after the lesson/lecture, write a 1–2 sentence summary of the notes on that page.

Practice:

This is a good method of practice which I read about recently here: (Schmidt, A. (2016). Listening Journal for Extensive and Intensive Listening Practice. English Teaching Forum, 54 (2).)

Go to [TED Talks | TED.com](http://ted.com/talks "ted.com") and find a talk that’s under 6 minutes and has subtitles in your first language. then follow these steps:

1. Watch the talk without any subtitles and take notes. Do not pause the video, just keep watching and taking notes.
2. Watch the same talk again, but this time with English subtitles. Take notes again, as if you were watching it for the first time.
3. Watch the talk with subtitles in your mother tongue. Take notes as if you were watching it for the first time.
4. Answer the following questions:

- Compare your no-subtitle notes to your English subtitle notes

–What percentage did you understand without subtitles?

–What information did you get when you listened without subtitles? What kind of information did you miss?

–Why do you think you missed this information?

-Compare your English subtitle notes to your native-language subtitle notes

–Did you miss or misunderstand any major or important ideas? Did you miss any minor details or specific examples?

–Why do you think you missed or misunderstood this information?

You should be able to identify your weak areas of listening and note-taking. You can now focus your listening practice on those specific areas to improve.
