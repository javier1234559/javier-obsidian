# Comparison of Major Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Platforms

## Bitcoin (BTC)

### Key Characteristics:
- First and most well-known cryptocurrency
- Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism
- Limited programmability (Script language)
- Emphasis on security and decentralization

### Main Applications:
- Digital gold / Store of value
- Peer-to-peer electronic cash system
- Settlement layer for financial transactions

## Ethereum (ETH)

### Key Characteristics:
- Smart contract platform
- Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism (after "The Merge")
- Turing-complete programming (Solidity, Vyper)
- Large developer ecosystem

### Main Applications:
- Decentralized applications (DApps)
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) / Token sales

## Solana (SOL)

### Key Characteristics:
- High throughput (up to 65,000 TPS)
- Proof of Stake (PoS) with Proof of History (PoH)
- Low transaction costs
- Programming in Rust

### Main Applications:
- DeFi applications requiring high speed
- NFT marketplaces
- High-frequency trading platforms
- Scalable decentralized applications
