#### [Monorepo](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-platform/glossary#monorepo)

A monorepo, short for "monolithic repository", is a version control strategy in which many packages or modules are stored in a single repository. This approach stands in contrast to a [multi-repo](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-platform/glossary#multi-repo) approach, where each package or module has its own separate repository

Front end include 3 popular architecture include
- Monolith
	- Pros: Easy to start
	- Cons: Hard to scale
- Micro - FrontEnd
	- Pros: Adopting many tech stack , easy mantainability
	- Cons: Code dupication , Extra effort in review and migration
- Monorepo
	- Pros: Code/lib reuse , faster review, updating major dependencies/lint rule easy
	- Cons: No way to restrict the access only for some part of app , To many packages lead to long boostrap times , the code navigation is slower

Some mono repo lib include
- Nx 
- Pnpm/Yarn workspace
- rush(By microsoft)
- Lerna 
- Bazel buiild (By google)
- Turbo repo  (By vercel seem minimalist than Nx)
