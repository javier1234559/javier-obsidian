1. Tạo VM instance

```shell
# create instance with cloud cli
gcloud auth login
gcloud compute instances create recruitment-service --zone='asia-east2-b' \
--machine-type=e2-micro
gcloud compute ssh --project=recruitment-service-spring --zone=asia-east2-b recruitment-service

# connect to instance
ssh nhat@34.150.105.231
ssh -i /home/nhat/.ssh/google_compute_engine nhat@34.150.105.231
scp -i /home/nhat/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub -r mysql nhat@34.150.105.231:/home/project

```

## Life cycle of container

1. **Image Creation**: The first step is to create a Docker image. This is done using a Dockerfile, which is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using `docker build`, users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

2. **Container Creation**: Once the image is ready, you can create a container from it using the `docker create` command. This command creates a writeable container layer over the specified image and prepares it for running the specified command. The container ID is then printed to STDOUT. This is a low-level command and usually not needed because `docker run` automatically creates a container if it doesn’t exist.

3. **Container Start**: After creating a container, you can start it using the `docker start` command. This command starts a previously created container. If the container was already running, this command has no effect.

4. **Running Containers**: While the container is running, you can interact with it using various Docker commands. For example, you can attach to the container using `docker attach`, execute a command in the container using `docker exec`, or inspect the container using `docker inspect`.

5. **Container Stop**: When you're done with the container, you can stop it using the `docker stop` command. This command stops a running container.

6. **Container Removal**: After stopping a container, you can remove it using the `docker rm` command. This command removes one or more containers. By default, it removes only the container and its immediate writable layer above the specified image.
