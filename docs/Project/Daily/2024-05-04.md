- [https://akash.network](https://akash.network/) is the future. Use [https://deploy.cloudmos.io](https://deploy.cloudmos.io/) and you can deploy any Dockerfile on decentralized infrastructure permissionless using blockchain. You use AKT coin (Cosmos based) to deploy on the network. No credit card or signup required and no minimums. You must trust the provider you deploy on but they also have datacenter providers like CherryServers. Huge container limits, 256 CPU - 512Gb Memory - 32Tb disk pods can be requested. Great for HPC.
