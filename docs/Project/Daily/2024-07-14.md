# Learn graphQL


## 1. The difference and purpose of Graphql
Source :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6r4IzofPVc 
The key difference between graphQl and restful like the video said is the nested and for the connection data like social media 
- Like the restful api are particularly suited to traditional table-based setup , where each row is represents an object . In term of RESTFUL it called resources
- The facebook (which is a social network in general) are about the relationship between things . The friendship ,like .. are represents as a graph .GraghQL purpose is to traverse this graph across differents kinds of project
- Example You have to design a like button . When the user click to that , if will need to send a notification to other . Input you will need 
	- current liked user 
	- the post
	- owner of that post
### The difference between Graphql and Apollo 
### GraphQL Core of Facebook

**Includes:**
- **GraphQL Specification**: Defines syntax, data types, queries, and mutations.
- **GraphQL.js**: Official library for building GraphQL servers in Node.js.
- **GraphiQL**: Web IDE for testing and debugging GraphQL queries.

**Example Syntax:**

**Schema Definition:**
```graphql
type Todo {
  id: ID!
  text: String!
  completed: Boolean!
}

type Query {
  todos: [Todo]
}

type Mutation {
  addTodo(text: String!): Todo
  toggleTodoCompleted(id: ID!): Todo
}
```

**Example Query:**
```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    text
    completed
  }
}
```

**Example Mutation:**
```graphql
mutation {
  addTodo(text: "Learn GraphQL") {
    id
    text
    completed
  }
}
```

### Purpose of Other GraphQL Providers

**Why Needed:**
- **Client-Side Libraries**: Manage state, caching, and connect to GraphQL servers.
- **Advanced Tooling**: Develop, test, and monitor APIs.
- **Caching**: Optimize performance by reducing unnecessary network requests.
- **Subscriptions**: Real-time updates.
- **Schema Stitching and Federation**: Combine multiple schemas and microservices.

### Popular Libraries to Work with GraphQL

1. **Apollo Client**: Manages state and caching on the client-side, integrates with React, Angular, and Vue.
2. **Apollo Server**: Framework for building GraphQL servers quickly, supports data sources, schema stitching, and subscriptions.
3. **Relay**: Developed by Facebook, focuses on performance and scalability for GraphQL clients.
4. **GraphQL Yoga**: Easy-to-setup GraphQL server based on Express and Apollo Server.
5. **Prisma**: Modern ORM for GraphQL, simplifies querying and manipulating data from databases.

### Client-Side Examples Using Apollo Client

**Setting up Apollo Client:**
```javascript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

**Query Example:**
```javascript
client
  .query({
    query: gql`
      query GetTodos {
        todos {
          id
          text
          completed
        }
      }
    `,
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

**Mutation Example:**
```javascript
client
  .mutate({
    mutation: gql`
      mutation AddTodo {
        addTodo(text: "Learn GraphQL") {
          id
          text
          completed
        }
      }
    `,
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```



## 3. How to setup a GraphQL

GraphQL sử dụng HTTP như phương thức truyền tải, nhưng cách truy vấn và đột biến dữ liệu khác biệt so với REST. Để setup một server và client sử dụng GraphQL, cần có thư viện để bọc quanh route nhận request GraphQL trên server và thư viện để gửi truy vấn từ client.
