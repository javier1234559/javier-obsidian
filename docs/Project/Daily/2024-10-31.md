Ok now i need to brainstorm the idea at here 
We will have some state now 
Begin it will show 
When create
- check
	- disable start edit 
	- submit this state
	- turn in to toggle or delete
- start edit
	- disappear check and start edit 
	- expand the form to correct
	- save to submit the form 
	- turn into a toggle or delete

When update
- check
	- save this state as green 
	- have a toggle of it or delete
	- click to toggle then change back to editing state or check
	- cancel to remove changes
- start edit
	- save the default data
	- have a toggle of it or delete
	- click to toggle then change back to editing state or check
	- cancel to remove change
